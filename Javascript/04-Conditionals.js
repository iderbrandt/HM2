         Extra:
         1) solve this task by creating your own method "someHigh" which takes several parameters. Then use it like this:

             if (someHigh (50, bigFoot, shoeAli, shoeMaria))
                 console.log ("One of them has really big feet");

         2) solve this task with ".some"
