# Hint

Practice the following (with Management Studio):

Using the GUI:
- Create a new database
- Create tables
- Create primary keys and foreign keys 

SQL:
- Write basic SQL-commands (insert, update, delete, select, select with join)

Futher hints: do the Bokus-exercise yourself, once again from scratch. Add some data. Write simple SQL querys to the database.
