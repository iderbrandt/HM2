# Project - modeling the database

## Brainstorming

Divide in random groups (3-4 in each group)

Brainstorm ideas in a few minutes on domains for databases. 

We write proposals and every group chooses one domain.For each domain, try to find examples of tables/entities that can be included.

## Specify 

Write down what you should model in a textfile or word document. Use natural language.

If you later change this document, keep a copy of the original version so history is preserved.

## Execute 

Create a ER-diagram with:
- Multiple **one-to-many** relationships
- One or more **many-to-many** relationships

The ER-diagram must contain at least 6 entities.

Model the database from the ER-diagram. 

Take a screenshot of the database model **every hour** (to get the history)

Deliver your project to another group:
- The specification in natural language (which a client / project manager can understand)
- Screenshot on the lastest ER-diagram and database-diagram

## Criticism (1h)

Read another group's specification. Look at the ER-diagram and database diagram.

Try to find as many shortcomings as possible with the colleague's solution:
- Incorrect tables/entities
- Wrong relationships
- Unclear naming of tables/entities, fields
- Unclear data types
- Give suggestions on how the database model can be expanded / improved

## Update 

Update your model based on the other project group feedback.

## Presentation 

Present you work in 5 minutes where you answer:
- Who is in your team?
- Why did you choose this model?
- Explains history.
    * The development of the ER-diagram
    * The development of the specification
- Explain the end result (ER-diagram + database diagram + specification)
- Show some detail of the solution that is interesting
- What benefit did you have from the criticism?
- What have you learned?
- What was challenging? 
- If you continued, what would you do then?
